# Weather Fan

This overall design of this app is based off of the [AppBrewery Clima](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/Clima-Flutter) tutorial but was built from scratch in Dart v2.14 with null safety, additional features and error checking, and my own implementation of geolocation and OpenWeatherMap API calls. 

## Modifications

- Uses null safety
- Handles failures to request weather data
- Additional page to re-request permission data if initial denied
- Exits app without returning to loading screen
- Different implementation for geolocation retrieveal, OpenWeatherMap API calls, and response data management
- Different fonts and image assets
- Add app icon courtesy of <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/good-ware" title="Good Ware">Good Ware</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a>
